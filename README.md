# Final-Project
Our project is a research project. During the project, we conducted an experiment in which various aspects of human problem solving were investigated.
The main objectives of the project are:
Firstly, to examine the relationship between the explanatory variables in the study
which are visual presentation and difficulty level of the problem to the explained variables in the study
which are duration of the problem solving, solution's correctness, subjective estimation of the problem difficulty,
confidence level of the experimenter in his solution and solution moves.
Secondly, using machine learning algorithms in order to classify the solution moves and the behavior of each experimenter to a group.

In order to perform the experiment, we developed a web system that includes an interface for the Sudoku game and the Knapsack problem.
Each experimenter must solve a total of two problems of each one in some random order, 
while each problem is different from the other by its visual presentation and difficulty level (e.g. Sudoku with numbers and Sudoku with colors).
In addition, the experimenter is asked to answer several relevant metacognitive questions for the study.
